Evaluating the quality of clustering results is often subjective, as it depends on the specific problem and the goals of the analysis.
However, there are some quantitative metrics and qualitative methods you can use to assess the quality of your clusters:

Silhouette Score: The silhouette score is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
It ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better clustering. A value near 1 means the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to other clusters,
while a value near -1 means the opposite.

Calinski-Harabasz Index: Also known as the Variance Ratio Criterion, this index measures the ratio of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion.
A higher value indicates better clustering.

Davies-Bouldin Index: This index measures the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar one. Lower values indicate better clustering.

Inertia (within-cluster sum of squares): This is the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center. Lower values indicate better clustering,
but this metric is sensitive to the number of clusters (more clusters will generally result in lower inertia).

Visual inspection: Plotting the data and examining the clusters visually can give you a rough idea of how well-separated the clusters are.
You can also use dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE to visualize the clusters in a lower-dimensional space.

Domain knowledge: Understanding the context and purpose of the clustering can help you determine if the clusters make sense.
This might involve validating the results with subject-matter experts, comparing the results with known patterns, or exploring the clusters to see if they reveal interesting or meaningful insights.

Keep in mind that no single metric can definitively determine the quality of your clusters. It's important to consider multiple factors
and use your judgment to decide if the clustering is suitable for your specific problem and goals.
