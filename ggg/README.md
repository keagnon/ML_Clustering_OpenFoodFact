# Projet_ML_Clustering_OpenFoodFact
Objectifs : Répondre à un problème réel de la communauté d'Open Food Fact afin de les aider à résoudre un de leur défi, à savoir proposer des méthodes de clustering pour améliorer la catégorisation des produits de manière plus fine que celle existante.


Introduction:
The goal of this project was to create a data processing and clustering pipeline to identify patterns and groups of similar products in a given dataset. The dataset consisted of information about various food products, such as their nutritional content, ingredients, and brand information. The objective was to cluster similar food products together based on their characteristics and generate insights about the groups.


The project consisted of several steps, including data cleaning, feature engineering, data preprocessing, and clustering. Initially, we loaded the dataset and performed some basic data cleaning to remove any missing values or irrelevant columns. Then, we used feature engineering techniques to transform and extract meaningful features from the data. Next, we performed data preprocessing by scaling the data and reducing the dimensionality of the dataset to prepare it for clustering. Finally, we applied KMeans clustering to group the data points into clusters and generated visualizations to help interpret the results.

To aid in the interpretation of the clusters, we created a few additional functions to generate word clouds for each cluster and visualize the top features for each cluster using a radar chart.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project demonstrated how to create a data processing and clustering pipeline to identify patterns and groups of similar products in a given dataset. By performing data cleaning, feature engineering, data preprocessing, and clustering, we were able to successfully group similar food products together and generate insights about the clusters. This pipeline can be applied to other datasets and can help identify patterns and groups of similar products in other industries as well.
